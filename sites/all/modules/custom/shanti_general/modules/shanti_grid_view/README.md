Description
--------------------
The Shanti Grid View module provides a Views format to display an interactive gallery for viewing images similar to the 
images result page when searching in Google. It displays thumbnails of a certain size in a fluid grid, which when clicked 
on open down into a larger version of the image and further description and details of the image. It further provides 
a fullscreen lightbox slideshow view of the gallery. 

The view is field-based and can be display either files or nodes. Two fields are required an image thumbnail field and 
a larger image field to show in the drop down. These can and probably should be the same image displayed with different 
size image styles. For thumbnails a height between 150-200 seems best. For the larger size something between 1000 and 2000+, 
since the large size is also used for the lightbox fullscreen view.

When these fields have been added to the view, one should choose the format "Shanti Grid" and under the settings asign 
the thumbnail image and the larger image.
