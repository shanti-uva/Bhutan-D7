# Hammer JS Library

This is contributed library from https://hammerjs.github.io/ 
It is used to create mobile touch/swipe actions and responses on a site.
It has been used in various places on the Mandala Suite 
We created this "library" to store it in a centralized place.

There are two files. Hammer.min.js provide the mobile actions, while hammer-time.min.js reduces the delay in response time. 

The versions here are:

* hammer.min.js:  v2.0.8
* hammer-time.min.js: v1.1.0
